# Bayesian Mixture Analysis Project

This repository contains a project report for my 4th year course 'Bayesian Inference', where I used a dataset and performed Bayesian mixture analysis and cluster classification on the dataset in R. The ```.rmd``` file is the raw file, and the ```.html``` file is the rendered output for the project.

## Synopsis

This project uses the R dataset ```palmer-penguins``` to analyse the sub-populations of penguin species recorded in the dataset, using Bayesian statistical methods. The data cleaning, exploration, analysis and visualisation are performed in R.
